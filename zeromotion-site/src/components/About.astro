      <p class="text-white/85 text-lg mb-4">We believe Houma, Thibodaux, and every town around us are packed with talent, grit, and potential. The only thing missing? A digital presence to match it.</p>
      <p class="text-white/85 text-lg mb-4">We design clean, timeless brands and high-performance web experiences that move with intent — from identity to interface to impression.</p>
      <p class="text-white/80">This is the moment to step forward. To take the skills, the stories, and the hustle of our community and put them where the world can see them. We keep the stack lean, the UX elegant, and the speed uncompromised — so your brand isn’t just seen, it’s remembered.</p>
