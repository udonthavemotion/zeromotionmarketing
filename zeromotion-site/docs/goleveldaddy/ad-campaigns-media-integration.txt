GoHighLevel (GHL) integration points — Ad Campaigns & Media

Pre-launch
- Create GHL pipeline: Ads → New Lead → Contacted → Booked → Won
- Create form fields: name, business (optional), phone (required), email (optional), service (long text)
- Auto SMS: trigger on new form submission; reply with “Thanks! We’ll text or call within 1 business day.”
- Call connect workflow: during business hours, immediately dial internal number on new lead

Embed on site
- Endpoint: /api/lead (already present). Ensure serverless function forwards payload to GHL (Contacts + Pipeline)
- Add hidden UTM fields if needed: utm_source, utm_campaign, gclid
- Webhook: configure GHL webhook (fallback) to /api/lead for redundancy

Tracking
- GA4 via GTM: event form_submit, call_click, cta_click with labels for this page context
- Microsoft Clarity: verify session recordings on /services/ad-campaigns-media

Post-launch QA
- Test form → GHL contact creation → pipeline stage → auto SMS sent
- Verify weekly report sheet pulls from GHL exports (leads, CPL, calls)

Notes
- Respect SMS hours and opt-in rules
- If GHL not available, send email via Resend as fallback
